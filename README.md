The documentation of D14Engine series projects is maintained with this repository.

## Remarks

Logo 中的“文档”两个汉字为小篆体。中国的第一个皇帝秦始皇在统一六国后，推行“书同文”政策，而小篆被选为全国通用的字体。文档作为一种特殊的资料，正有着“统一认知”的作用。

The two Chinese characters 文档 (means documentation) in the logo are in Xiao Zhuan (Small Seal Script). The first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, implemented the policy of Shu Tong Wen (unification of the written language) after conquered the six kingdoms, and Xiao Zhuan was selected as the common font. Documentation is the special literature that are used to unify congnition.
