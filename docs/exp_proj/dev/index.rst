Developer Guides
================

D14UIKit is developed with `Visual Studio`_, so you need to prepare the necessary toolchain and environment before getting started. You need to install the **C++ Desktop Development** and the **Python Development** workloads, and install the *Python native development tools* (which is not checked by default). For more information about the mixed-programming of C++ and Python in Visual Studio, please see this article: `Write C++ extensions for Python in Visual Studio`_.
